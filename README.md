Hi My name is Darrin, 
Im 40 and wnating and needing exciting challenges and changes in life on a regular basis
6 yrs ago i studied at Tafe western in NSW to gain a cert III idmt part while still working full time
to help get me recognised as having knowledge and understanding in the I.T. field.  
life took a turn for quite a few years, and here i am back making and finding the time to continue what i started 
as a continuation from when i was 7 and got my first C64.
my interest, knowledge and excitement grows continually as i step forward in my lifelong journey to create, share,
learn, and help others in various ways and facets of life. 
<will add more soon>
